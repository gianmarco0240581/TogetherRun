Code of the desktop and web implementation of ISPW Project (A.A. 2020/21) - **TogetherRun**

The aim of the project, called “TogetherRun”, is to create a platform for meetings between runners.<br>
The system allows registered users to organize themselves to carry out running training sessions together.<br><br>
To do this, TogetherRun supports several functions, such as: 
- the possibility to create a training event, specifying some general and technical aspects
- the possibility to search for and participate in an event created by another user
- the possibility to manage the participations in the various training events
and other less important functions.
